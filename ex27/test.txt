Question 1:
What are 2 ways to preview ads on TikTok Ads Manager? 
Response:

Dear (Customer Name),

My name is Christian, and I am a member of the TikTok Support Team. I'm here to assist you with your inquiries today. Currently, you can preview your ads on TikTok Ads Manager or on your mobile device. In the Ads Manager, after creating your ad, a preview box shows how the ad looks. You can switch between app and ad format previews there. For mobile previews, you can generate a QR code in the Ads Manager and scan it with your TikTok app to see how the ad appears in the feed or you can use a User ID to access this option. 
For a detailed step by step explanation of the process, please refer to the following link from the TikTok Business Help Center:

Warm regards,

Christian
